# IntroToSEProjectFall2024
Project for Intro to SE during the Fall 2024 Semester.

This project is going to be written in Python3 using SQLite3 as the database backend.

## Names

* Boatwright, Brennan (bdb600)
* Carattini, Jordyn (jbc636)
* Reid, Scott (smr638)
* Lofton, Maddux (msl279)

We are Group 4 on Canvas.

## Repository Contribution Rules

* All changes MUST go through a pull request
* Pushes cannot go directly towards the main branch, use another branch
* ALL commits MUST be named `Sprint #: Update README.md to include the new repo rules`, replacing the # with the sprint number we are on and the message with whatever is being updated
* * Merge commits are exempt from this rule as they are sometimes autogenerated by Github
  * Be sure to include the file you're editing
  * Don't include punctuation in the first line of a commit message as it is the commit title, it keeps the commit page cleaner.

## Description
This is going to be a simple website (not web application) for ecommerce, just like Amazon and the like are. Obviously this project will NOT be as complex as Amazon, however, it is just a little something to showcase our software development skills.

## Languages

* Python 3
* SQLite

These languages will run on a local machine.
